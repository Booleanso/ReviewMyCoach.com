# Coach Profile Claiming System

## üéØ **Overview**

A comprehensive system that allows importing coach data from PDFs, creating unclaimed profiles, and enabling users to claim their profiles through identity verification during onboarding.

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **1. Data Import Pipeline (Python Script)**
- **Location**: `reviewmycoach-python-venv/upload-coaches.py`
- **Purpose**: Extract coach data from PDFs and create unclaimed profiles in Firebase

### **2. Profile Claiming API**
- **Location**: `app/api/coaches/claim/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handle profile discovery and claiming

### **3. Identity Verification API**
- **Location**: `app/api/identity/verify/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Process driver's license verification

### **4. Enhanced Onboarding Flow**
- **Location**: `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Guide users through profile claiming and verification

## üîÑ **Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: Data Import**
```bash
# From reviewmycoach-python-venv/
python upload-coaches.py --pdf "pdfs/Staff Directory.pdf" --key firebase-key.json
```

**What happens:**
- ‚úÖ Parses PDF for lines containing "coach" keyword
- ‚úÖ Extracts names, emails, phone numbers with area code formatting
- ‚úÖ Maps sports from role descriptions (e.g., "Basketball Coach" ‚Üí ["Basketball"])
- ‚úÖ Creates complete coach profiles with ReviewMyCoach structure
- ‚úÖ Sets `isClaimed: false` and `userId: null` for unclaimed status
- ‚úÖ Stores in `coaches/{username}` collection

**Coach Profile Structure Created:**
```javascript
{
  username: "dickson",
  displayName: "Mike Dickson",
  email: "dickson@rowan.edu",
  phoneNumber: "(856) 256-4687",
  sports: ["Baseball"],
  role: "Assistant Athletic Director/Head Baseball Coach",
  organization: "Rowan University Athletics",
  location: "New Jersey",
  bio: "Experienced assistant athletic director/head baseball coach specializing in baseball.",
  experience: 5,
  averageRating: 0,
  totalReviews: 0,
  isClaimed: false,      // üîë Key field
  userId: null,          // üîë Will be linked when claimed
  verificationStatus: "pending",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  // ... full coach profile structure
}
```

### **Step 2: User Registration & Discovery**
When a user signs up with an email that matches an unclaimed coach profile:

1. **Username Setup**: User enters their desired username
2. **Profile Discovery**: System automatically checks for claimable profiles
3. **Profile Presentation**: Shows matching profiles with details

### **Step 3: Profile Claiming Process**

#### **3A: Profile Selection**
```typescript
// API: GET /api/coaches/claim?email=user@email.com
// Returns: Array of claimable profiles
```

User sees:
- Coach name and role
- Organization affiliation
- Sports coached
- Phone number (if available)
- "Claim Profile" button for each match

#### **3B: Identity Verification**
If user chooses to claim a profile:

**Required Information:**
- Full name (as appears on license)
- Date of birth
- Address
- Phone number
- **Driver's License Photo** (JPEG, PNG, or PDF)

**API Call:**
```typescript
// POST /api/identity/verify
// FormData with driver's license file + personal info
```

### **Step 4: Verification & Claiming**
1. **Profile Claim**: Links `userId` to coach profile, sets `isClaimed: true`
2. **Identity Storage**: Stores verification data in `identity_verifications` collection
3. **Admin Notification**: Creates admin task for manual review
4. **User Redirect**: Sends to dashboard with claimed profile

## üìä **Database Structure**

### **Coaches Collection** (`coaches/{username}`)
```javascript
{
  // Basic Info
  username: string,
  displayName: string,
  email: string,
  phoneNumber?: string,
  
  // Coaching Details
  sports: string[],
  role: string,
  organization: string,
  location: string,
  bio: string,
  experience: number,
  
  // Profile Status
  isClaimed: boolean,        // üîë False for unclaimed profiles
  userId: string | null,     // üîë Links to authenticated user
  claimedAt: Date | null,
  verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'in_review' | 'verified' | 'rejected',
  
  // Full coach profile structure...
}
```

### **Identity Verifications Collection** (`identity_verifications/{userId}`)
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  userEmail: string,
  coachUsername: string,
  personalInfo: {
    fullName: string,
    dateOfBirth: string,
    address: string,
    phoneNumber: string
  },
  driversLicense: {
    fileName: string,
    fileType: string,
    fileSize: number,
    fileData: string,  // Base64 encoded (use cloud storage in production)
    uploadedAt: Date
  },
  status: 'submitted' | 'in_review' | 'approved' | 'rejected',
  submittedAt: Date,
  reviewedAt: Date | null,
  reviewedBy: string | null,
  reviewNotes: string
}
```

### **Admin Notifications Collection** (`admin_notifications`)
```javascript
{
  type: 'identity_verification',
  title: string,
  message: string,
  userId: string,
  coachUsername: string,
  priority: 'normal' | 'high',
  status: 'unread' | 'read' | 'resolved',
  createdAt: Date
}
```

## üé® **User Experience Flow**

### **Scenario 1: Coach Profile Found**
1. User signs up with `dickson@rowan.edu`
2. System finds "Mike Dickson - Baseball Coach" profile
3. Shows profile card with claim option
4. User clicks "Claim Profile"
5. Identity verification form appears
6. User uploads driver's license
7. Profile claimed, verification submitted for review

### **Scenario 2: No Profile Found**
1. User signs up with email not in system
2. Proceeds directly to role selection
3. Can create new coach profile as normal

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Profiles**
1. User email matches multiple profiles (rare)
2. Shows all claimable profiles
3. User selects which one to claim
4. Single verification process

## üîí **Security Features**
